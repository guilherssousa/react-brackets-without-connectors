# React Brackets, without Connectors

[react-brackets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-brackets) adds pretty cool Bracket features to be used on React applications. But its docs are a bit lacking: There's no way to know if a double bracket has a ending match and to set a new seed without connectors for it.

That's why this repo exists. It makes a clone of an original Seed and remove its connectors to support better visual understanding of it structure.
